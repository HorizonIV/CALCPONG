# CALCPONG
A custom version of pong for your TI-84 plus CE calculator.

The calculator on the left is controlled with the 2nd key and the alpha key, the calculator on the right is controlled with the up and down arrow keys.

This was my first project ever in c/c++ for the TI-84 plus CE calculator, so the code may not be the best, but i've tried my best to restructure the original source code and add comments so that the code makes more sense :)

Since this was the first game that I made for the TI-84 plus CE calculator, it's also not the most feature rich version of Pong(there is no score counter...). But you are always free to add new features.
